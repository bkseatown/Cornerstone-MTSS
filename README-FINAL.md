   - Added `const WORDS_DATA =` declaration

## 🎨 UI Design

This keeps your **clean, simple design**:
- Compact header (not taking up too much space)
- Small utility buttons (?, 📊, Aa) - discrete and minimal
- Your original welcome modal (simple Wordle-style)
- Clean game interface

The new buttons are small and don't take much space. The modals are simple placeholders - you can enhance them later if you want.

## 🔧 Future UI Improvements (Optional)

If you want to make the header even more compact later, we could:
- Make the utility buttons into a dropdown menu
- Add a collapsible controls section
- Move some controls into a settings panel

But first, let's get this working error-free!
